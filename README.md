# MTTR-MTBF Analyzer: Maintenance Metrics and Equipment Performance

This project aims to conduct a detailed analysis of maintenance metrics and equipment performance in a refinery, using data on failures and maintenance costs. Through the MTTR (Mean Time To Repair) and MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures) metrics, the project provides insights into equipment efficiency and helps identify areas for improvement in the maintenance process.

## Key Features

### 1. Data Import
Imports failure, maintenance, and equipment information from Excel spreadsheets.

### 2. Metric Calculation
- **MTTR (Mean Time To Repair):** Determines the average time required to repair an equipment after a failure.
- **MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures):** Calculates the average time between failures of an equipment, helping to assess its reliability.

### 3. Maintenance Cost
Calculates and analyzes the total maintenance costs for each equipment.

### 4. Failure Cause Analysis
Identifies and classifies the most frequent causes of failures.

### 5. Interactive Visualization
Generates dynamic graphs to facilitate the analysis of MTTR, MTBF, and maintenance cost metrics, as well as to display the best and worst-performing equipment.

## Benefits
With this analysis, the project provides a strategic view to optimize maintenance operations, reduce costs, and improve equipment availability.
