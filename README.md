# -MTTR-MTBF-Analyzer-Maintenance-Metrics-and-Equipment-Performance
This project aims to conduct a detailed analysis of maintenance metrics and equipment performance in a refinery, using data on failures and maintenance costs. Through the MTTR (Mean Time To Repair) and MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures) metrics, the project provides insights into equipment efficiency.
